 ## Flask Application Design for Sunglass Identification

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the user interface for the application.
- It should contain a form with an input field for the user to enter the image of the sunglass.
- The form should also have a submit button that triggers the Flask route to process the image and identify the sunglass.

**2. results.html**
- This HTML file will display the results of the sunglass identification.
- It should include a section to display the identified sunglass, along with any additional information such as brand, model, and price.

### Routes

**1. /index**
- This route will render the index.html file, displaying the form for the user to input the sunglass image.

**2. /identify**
- This route will be triggered when the user submits the form on the index.html page.
- It will receive the uploaded sunglass image and process it using a suitable image processing library (e.g., OpenCV) to identify the sunglass.
- Once the sunglass is identified, it will render the results.html file, displaying the identified sunglass and any additional information.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should include a way to handle errors, such as when the user uploads an invalid image or when the sunglass identification fails.
- The application should also consider security aspects, such as preventing unauthorized access to the uploaded images.
- The design can be further enhanced by adding additional features, such as allowing users to browse a database of sunglass models or providing recommendations based on the identified sunglass.
